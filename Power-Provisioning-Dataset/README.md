### Dataset Overview:

This dataset is associated with our publication titled "A Global Perspective on Supercomputer Power Provisioning: Case Studies from United States and Europe", to appear at the ACM International Conference on Supercomputing in June 2025 (DOI: TBD). Please cite this paper when using this dataset.

It contains power telemetry data from seven supercomputers across six sites.
The supercomputers considered at each site, identified by their name and associated Top500 rank at the time of data collection, are:
1. Perlmutter (\#12) and Cori (\#60), at National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), United States
2. Summit (\#7), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), United States
3. Sierra (\#10), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), United States
4. Marconi-100 (\#35), CINECA, Italy
5. Lumi (\#5), CSC IT Center for Science Ltd., Finland
6. Hawk (\#42), High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS), Germany

### CSV Descriptions:

Each CSV file is identified by the system it belongs to along with the sampling rate of power measurements (frequency of data collection).  
It has two columns, timestamp (in seconds) and measured power in kilowatts.

- Cori (LBL), Perlmutter (LBL), Marconi-100 (Cineca), Lumi (CSC) and Hawk (HLRS) are full datasets.
- Summit (ORNL) and Sierra (LLNL) datasets are a summary providing quartile information only.

Note: The Hawk dataset has ~1500 rows with leading zeros in the beginning, we did not modify the original dataset.

In addition to system-level telemetry, two additional application-level power measurement datasets (`lumi_hpcg_data` and `hlrs_hpl_hpcg_data` folders) have been included. These are:
- High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark power data from Lumi supercomputer.
- High-Performance Linpack (HPL) Benchmark and HPCG power data, along with the different power capping algorithms (Figure 5 in the paper), from the Hawk supercomputer.
